# Optional Netlify edge-proxy rule.
# app.js already routes all requests through corsproxy.io, so this rule is
# not required. It is kept here as a self-hosted alternative: if you want to
# avoid the corsproxy.io dependency when deployed on Netlify, change
# CONFIG.API_BASE in app.js to '/polymarket-api' and this rule will proxy
# requests at Netlify's edge instead.
